  invitation_token TEXT UNIQUE,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'expired', 'cancelled')),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment Notes

### Email Service Integration

To enable actual email sending in production, update `src/lib/emailService.ts`:

```typescript
// Example with SendGrid
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!);

export const sendEmail = async (emailTemplate: EmailTemplate) => {
  try {
    await sgMail.send(emailTemplate);
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
};
```

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key  # For production email
```

### Database Permissions

Ensure your Supabase project has:
- Email authentication enabled
- Proper RLS policies applied
- Functions deployed and accessible

## 📊 Benefits of This Implementation

## 🔧 Maintenance & Monitoring

### Regular Tasks

```sql
-- Clean up expired invitations older than 30 days
DELETE FROM teacher_invitations 
WHERE status = 'expired' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready school onboarding system that maintains proper data relationships and provides an excellent user experience for all stakeholders.
